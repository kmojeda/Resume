<h2>Who I Am</h2>
         <p class="wtf">I moved to San Francisco to fully immerse myself into the tech world. I am creative. I am a stickler for quality. I am a stickler for grammar and syntax. I love deadlines and I hate ambiguity. I like to win.</p>
<h2>Why I'm Here</h2>
        I am ready to dive into a community of work and rejoin a team. I enjoy writing, design, and a myriad of other individual creative tasks, but over time I've realized that I am at my best when I help the team by getting things done, and I help foster a clear, engaging, accountable environment.
<h2>Experience</h2>
    <div class="info">
      <h4>Case Manager, PHM San Francisco, CA 2011-Present</h4>
        I started working here in April 2011 as an Enrollment Specialist. I interacted with patients via phone and email, enrolling them in our weekly testing program to track their Coumadin intake with a meter we would provide. I answered questions and concerns to the best of my ability, constantly researching and asking questions to give the best possible answer I could. From there, I was promoted to an Insurance Verification Specialist, where I assisted thousands of patients in learning about how their insurance would cover their medications and medical needs. For the past five months, I've worked as a Case Manager, working directly with patients as a Customer Service Representative. In this position, I respond to patient needs via phone, email, and through website chat regarding the program and website issues, as well as working directly with doctors and clinics. In addition, I handle disputes in accordance to existing policies and procedures, and work with the management team and peers to effectively resolve high-priority issues. Ultimately, I make sure each and every patient has all of the information they need to test successfully, and to ultimately live a healthy and happy life.

      <h4>Customer Service, Graphic Designer, Minuteman Press Montclair, CA 2005-2008</h4>
        I worked for my grandfather for a little over three years.
