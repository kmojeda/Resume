<h2>Who I Am</h2>
         <p class="wtf">I moved to San Francisco to fully immerse myself into the tech world. I am creative. I am a stickler for quality. I am a stickler for grammar and syntax. I love deadlines and I hate ambiguity. I like to win.</p>
<h2>Why I'm Here</h2>
        I am ready to dive into a community of work and rejoin a team. I enjoy writing, design, and a myriad of other individual creative tasks, but over time I've realized that I am at my best when I help the team by getting things done, and I help foster a clear, engaging, accountable environment.
